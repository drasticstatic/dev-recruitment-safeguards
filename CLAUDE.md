# CLAUDE.md — dev-recruitment-safeguards

---

## ⚠ FIRST: sync this clone before you touch anything

```sh
git pull --rebase --autostash
```

Run this at the **start of every session**, before reading deeply or editing. Several agents and
Christopher push to these repos — including Cosmos agents that run unattended while nobody is at the
machine — so a clone can be behind by the time you open it.

**`--autostash` is what makes this safe on a dirty tree.** It stashes uncommitted changes, rebases
onto the remote, then reapplies them. Your in-progress work survives. Without it, `git pull --rebase`
refuses to run and you are tempted into something worse.

Why it matters more than it sounds:

- A stale clone **does not fail early.** It fails at push time, after the work is done, as a
  non-fast-forward rejection — the most expensive moment to discover it.
- The tempting fix at that point is `git push --force`, which discards whatever someone else pushed
  in the meantime. Syncing first removes the temptation.
- If a rebase does conflict, stop and resolve it deliberately. A conflict is information: someone
  else changed the same lines, and you want to know that *before* building on top of them.

**Fresh clone?** Also run `sh scripts/install-hooks.sh` — git hooks are not version-controlled, so
the commit-attribution hook stays inert until this clone is pointed at `.githooks/`. Details:
[`scripts/README.md`](./scripts/README.md).

## Security Rules (Non-Negotiable)

- **Never read, display, or reference `.env` files** — in any form
- **Never read or expose `service_account.json`** or any Google Cloud credential file
- **Never commit secrets** — if `git status` shows a credentials file or `service_account.json` staged, warn Christopher immediately and stop
- **Committee data is private** — member emails, Google Drive folder IDs, and unpublished submission content never appear in public-facing files or the public repo
- If an example env file is needed, create it with placeholder values only (e.g. `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH=./service_account.json`) — never real values

---

## Project Scope

- **Frontend:** GitHub Pages

---

## Repo Architecture

**Public repo** (`dev-recruitment-safeguards`)

---

## Context Rules

- This repo is self-contained — no cross-repo context needed

---

## File & Directory Rules

- Always ask Christopher before creating a new directory (confirm private vs public vs gitignored)
- Run `pngquant` before committing any images

---

## Commit Discipline

- Commit after every meaningful change
- Never leave uncommitted work at session end
- After every `git commit`, run `git push origin main`


---

## Before Cloning or Installing Any External Repo / Package

Before running `git clone`, `npm install`, `pip install`, or adding any external dependency:
1. **Review `package.json` scripts** — flag any `postinstall`, `preinstall`, or `prepare` hooks that execute shell commands
2. **Scan for credential harvesting** — look for patterns accessing `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `.env`, `process.env`, or system credential paths in unexpected files
3. **Verify provenance** — check GitHub repo age, star/fork count, recent commit activity, and maintainer identity
4. **Check for typosquatting** — verify package names exactly match the intended library (e.g. `lodash` not `1odash`)
5. **Audit unexpected network calls** — flag external HTTP requests in scripts, entrypoints, or install hooks
6. **When in doubt, ask Christopher before proceeding** with any install or clone

## Skills

Claude Code skills are structured prompt files that give the agent a repeatable procedure for common tasks. Only the header is read at context start; full body loads when triggered.

**Available in this repo:**

| Skill | Trigger |
|-------|---------|
| `/create-skill` | "create a skill for X" |
| `/startup` (global) | "startup" — any repo |

**Full skill library + deployment guide:** `trading-assistant/AGENT-SYNC/CROSS_REPO_SKILLS_DEPLOY.md`

## Canonical References

When skills, specs, or task files exist for a topic — follow the logic there, not here. This file holds identity, pointers, and short rules only.

- **AGENTS.md** — root-level config for all AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot)
- **AGENTS.override.md** — temporary task-specific overrides; delete when done (template: `~/code/my-template/AGENTS.override.md`)
- **Skills:** `.claude/skills/` — full procedure lives in the skill file; CLAUDE.md holds triggers only
- **Tasks:** `PENDING-TASKS.md` or `tasks.md` if present — active/completed task tracking
- **Agent handoffs:** `AGENT-SYNC/` (hub: `~/code/trading-assistant/`) — see `AGENT_SYNC.md` for current state
- **Memory:** `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/MEMORY.md` — auto-loaded; detail in topic files

## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

Rules:
- ALWAYS read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md before reading any source files, running grep/glob searches, or answering codebase questions. The graph is your primary map of the codebase.
- IF graphify-out/wiki/index.md EXISTS, navigate it instead of reading raw files
- For cross-module "how does X relate to Y" questions, prefer `graphify query "<question>"`, `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"`, or `graphify explain "<concept>"` over grep — these traverse the graph's EXTRACTED + INFERRED edges instead of scanning files
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).

## Commit Convention

Full fleet convention, shown here regardless of whether this specific repo currently has an Augment
Intent workspace pairing or NIM in active use — so a new repo (and its memory) doesn't need the
whole multi-agent suite re-explained from scratch. Which *application* launched a session decides
the agent name and engine, not which path — see
`anthropas-argus-alfred/sandbox/AGENT_IDENTITY_REFERENCE.md` and `INTENT_WORKTREE_LEGEND.md` for
the full rule.

- Alfred-Anthropic: `Co-Authored-By: Alfred · ClaudeCodeCLI · Anthropic [Sonnet-5/Opus-#/Haiku-#]`
- Alfred-NIM: `Co-Authored-By: Alfred-NIM · ClaudeCodeCLI · NVIDIA NIM · Z.ai [GLM-4.7]`
  (gateway then provider — `NVIDIA NIM` routes, `Z.ai` makes GLM; `Moonshot AI` for Kimi,
  `MiniMax` for MiniMax. Only those three have ever served through the proxy.)
- Kavanah-AugmentIntentUI-AuggieLogin: `Co-Authored-By: Kavanah · AugmentIntent · [model]`
- Kavanah-AugmentIntentUI-AnthropicLogin ("ClaudeMent"): `Co-Authored-By: Kavanah · ClaudeMent · Anthropic [model]`
- Kavanah-TerminalUI(macOS/Intent/VSCode standard terminal instance)-AnthropicLogin: `Co-Authored-By: Kavanah · ClaudeCodeCLI · Anthropic [model]`
- Mystarch (app-level Chief of Staff, cross-workspace reach): same engine options as Kavanah above, swap the agent name
- Auggie (native Augment CLI — currently hibernating, may return): `Co-Authored-By: Auggie · AugmentCLI · [model]`

## Commit attribution (enforced by hook)

Every commit must carry two git trailers:

```
Co-Authored-By: <Agent> · <Engine> · <Provider> [<Model>]                  # direct
Co-Authored-By: <Agent> · <Engine> · <Gateway> · <Provider> [<Model>]      # proxied
<Platform>-Session: <full session URL>
```

Model in **square brackets**, separator is U+00B7 MIDDLE DOT ( · ). Add `<Gateway>` **only when
inference is proxied** — it names what *routed* the request (`NVIDIA NIM`, `OpenRouter`), never who
made the model (`Z.ai`, `Moonshot AI`, `MiniMax`). The field order mirrors the `/model` selector
string, so `anthropic/nvidia_nim/z-ai/glm4.7` transcribes to `NVIDIA NIM · Z.ai [GLM-4.7]` —
read it left to right rather than memorising it. Local runtimes (`Ollama`, `llama.cpp`,
`LM Studio`) have no gateway: the weights ran on your machine, so the runtime is the Provider. The session
trailer is a **separate** line — folding it onto the `Co-Authored-By:` line breaks git trailer
parsing. Use the full session URL, never a truncated prefix. Key varies by platform:
`Claude-Session:` for Claude Code CLI, `Cosmos-Session:` for Cosmos.

`.githooks/commit-msg` rejects non-conforming commits. **Activate it once per clone:**

```sh
sh scripts/install-hooks.sh
```

Human-only commits: `git commit --no-verify`. **Canonical spec — single source of truth. Do not restate the field table locally; link it:**
[`my-template/AGENT-SYNC/README.md`](https://github.com/drasticstatic/my-template/blob/main/AGENT-SYNC/README.md)
